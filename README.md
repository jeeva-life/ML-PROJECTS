Forest Fire Prediction
This project aims to predict the likelihood of forest fires based on various environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, rainfall (in mm), location, and other relevant features. The model has been built using machine learning techniques and is deployed as a Flask application, allowing users to interact with the model and get real-time predictions.

Project Overview
Forest fires are a significant environmental concern, and early detection can help mitigate their impact. By utilizing machine learning algorithms, this project predicts the chances of a forest fire occurring based on historical data of temperature, humidity, rainfall, and other factors.

The project consists of the following components:

Flask Application: A web-based application to serve the prediction model.
Pickle Files:
model_prediction.pkl: The trained machine learning model for predicting the forest fire risk.
scaler.pkl: A scaler used to standardize input features for the model.
Jupyter Notebooks:
Data Preprocessing Notebook: The notebook used to clean and preprocess the data, including feature selection, handling missing values, and scaling.
Model Prediction Notebook: The notebook used for training and evaluating the machine learning model, incorporating hyperparameter tuning using Cross-Validation (CV) and Ridge Regression.
Features
Prediction: Users can input real-time values for temperature, humidity, rainfall, and other factors, and the app will predict the likelihood of a forest fire.
Data Preprocessing: A Jupyter notebook that performs essential data cleaning and preparation tasks before feeding the data to the model.
Model Training: The model prediction notebook provides insights into how the model is trained, evaluated, and saved, with hyperparameter tuning using Cross-Validation (CV) and Ridge Regression to optimize the modelâ€™s performance.
Technologies Used
Flask: For creating the web application to interact with the model.
Machine Learning Algorithms: For building the prediction model, including Ridge Regression for regularization and improving model performance.
Cross-Validation (CV): Used for hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model and prevent overfitting by validating the model on multiple subsets of the data.
Pickle: For saving and loading the model and scaler.
Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
Scikit-learn: For machine learning and model evaluation, including implementing Ridge Regression and Cross-Validation.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization in the Jupyter notebooks.
Files in the Project
app.py: The Flask application script that serves the model.
model_prediction.pkl: The trained model saved using Pickle.
scaler.pkl: The scaler object saved for standardizing input features.
data_preprocessing.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for data preprocessing and feature engineering.
model_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for training, testing, and saving the model, including hyperparameter tuning using Cross-Validation and Ridge Regression.

How the Model Works
The model was trained on historical data containing features such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and location, and it uses these features to predict the probability of a forest fire. After preprocessing the data and scaling the features, the model makes a prediction based on the input values.

To optimize the model's performance:

Ridge Regression is used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function, ensuring that the model generalizes well to unseen data.
Cross-Validation (CV) is employed to tune hyperparameters and select the best model by splitting the dataset into multiple subsets, training the model on some and validating on others to ensure robustness and reliability.
